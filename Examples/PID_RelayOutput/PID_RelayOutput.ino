/********************************************************
 * PID RelayOutput Example
 * Same as basic example, except that this time, the output
 * is going to a digital pin which (we presume) is controlling
 * a relay.  the pid is designed to Output an analog value,
 * but the relay can only be On/Off.
 *
 *   to connect them together we use "time proportioning
 * control"  it's essentially a really slow version of PWM.
 * first we decide on a window size (5000mS say.) we then 
 * set the pid to adjust its output between 0 and that window
 * size.  lastly, we add some logic that translates the PID
 * output into "Relay On Time" with the remainder of the 
 * window being "Relay Off Time"
